        "In this notebook, we will be exploring the fabeled **3n+1 conjecture**. This conjecture states that, starting with some number *n*, we can create a series by following two rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If *n* is an even number, divide it by 2\n",
        "2. if *n* is an odd number, have *n = 3n+1*\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these rules, we will result in a series containing each iteration and value of *n* as we progress, and, by the odd properties of this conjecture, the series will inveittibly begin repeating 4,2,1 over and over again. This is because 4 is even, so *n* = (4/2) = 2, 2 is even, so *n* = (2/2) = 1, and since 1 is odd, *n* = (3x1+1) = 4, and thus we arrive back at *n* = 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if we take *n* = 10, we find the resulting series: [ 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ... ] and so on. Once *n* = 4, the series has inevitibly begun, and the repeated 4,2,1 values will occur exclusivly. \n",

        "In order to explore this conjecture further, we have defined the following python function, **exploration(n)**, which takes a number *n*, and returns the resulting series in the form of a list based on the *3n+1 Conjecture*'s bounds. We can easily apply the rules of the *3n+1* conjecture to our defined function, by using a for loop to iterate a lot, and by setting control statments (if statements) to change the value of *n* to either *n/2* or *3n+1* depending on if *n* is even or odd. \n",

Each iteration, we will also append the newest computed value of *n* into a list to eventually return the first 100 indecies of the series created by the *3n+1* conjecture. \n",
